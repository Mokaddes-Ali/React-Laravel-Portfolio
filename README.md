This project is designed to help hotel chains and property managers efficiently manage multiple hotels, rooms, bookings, and users -all within a single secure platform.


Key Features:

Multi-Tenancy: Each hotel operator is a separate tenant, within its own rooms, guests, and bookings.

Role-based Access: There are different user roles, including Admins and Managers. Admins can assign or unassign to hotels, while managers can only access the hotel they're assigned to.

User Management: Admins can activate or deactivate user accounts and assign or unassign managers to hotels with just a click.


Room & Booking Management: The interface is bult with the React and Inertia js providing a smooth, single-page application.

-Secure Authentication: The system uses robust authentication, ensuring users only access what they're allowed to:


Specialk Logic:

-If a manager is not assigned to any  hotel, they'll see a message on their dashboard and have limited navigation options until an admin assigns them.

-Inactive users can't log in, except for admins who always have access.
